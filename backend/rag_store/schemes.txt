Type: Central  
Tags: income support, DBT, landholding farmers, financial inclusion, financial stability  

Description:  
The Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) is a flagship central government scheme launched in February 2019 to provide direct income support to all landholding farmer families in India, aiming to improve their financial stability and reduce dependency on informal credit sources. Under the scheme, each eligible farmer receives ₹6,000 per year, paid in three equal installments of ₹2,000 directly into their Aadhaar-linked bank accounts via Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT).

Originally targeted at small and marginal farmers holding up to 2 hectares of cultivable land, the scheme was later expanded to cover all landholding farmers regardless of land size. However, exclusion criteria apply to institutional landholders and individuals in higher income brackets, such as income-tax payers, professionals (doctors, engineers, lawyers), and retired pensioners above a certain income threshold.

The identification of beneficiaries is carried out by respective state and union territory governments, using digitized land records and verification protocols. The government has mandated e-KYC (electronic Know Your Customer) for all beneficiaries to reduce fraud and improve delivery efficiency.

The scheme is supported by a robust IT infrastructure, including mobile app integration, SMS notifications, beneficiary tracking portals, and grievance redressal mechanisms. The funds are often used by farmers to purchase seeds, fertilizers, small equipment, or to manage short-term household expenditures during the sowing and harvesting cycles.

As of 2025, more than ₹3 lakh crore has been disbursed to over 11 crore farmer families. The government continues to strengthen transparency by integrating the scheme with Aadhaar authentication, land record databases, and Jan Dhan accounts. The PM-KISAN scheme plays a vital role in ensuring a minimum assured income for millions of rural households and aligns with the national vision of doubling farmers' income.

It is one of the largest agricultural risk mitigation schemes in the world, designed to ensure farmers' income stability by minimizing their exposure to uncertainties during cultivation cycles.

The scheme covers a wide range of risks — from sowing failure to post-harvest losses — across all major crop seasons (Kharif and Rabi) and includes cereals, pulses, oilseeds, and horticultural crops. Farmers pay a highly subsidized premium: 2% for Kharif crops, 1.5% for Rabi crops, and 5% for commercial and horticultural crops. The remaining premium is shared equally by the central and state governments, making it one of the most affordable insurance schemes for farmers.

PMFBY enrollment is mandatory for loanee farmers (those who take institutional credit) and voluntary for non-loanee farmers. The scheme uses cutting-edge technologies such as remote sensing, satellite imagery, drone-based crop assessments, GPS-enabled crop-cutting experiments, and AI-powered loss estimations to ensure timely and accurate compensation.

Claims are assessed at the notified insurance unit level (typically village or panchayat) and paid out electronically to the farmers’ bank accounts. To ensure transparency and accountability, the government has introduced the Crop Insurance Portal, DigiClaim software, mobile apps, and farmer helpdesks. Farmers can also use geo-tagged photos to report crop damage.

Since its inception, the scheme has insured over 7 crore farmers and facilitated claims of more than ₹1.3 lakh crore. It has helped reduce agrarian distress in climate-vulnerable regions, improved institutional credit access, and increased the confidence of small and marginal farmers in adopting improved agricultural practices.
